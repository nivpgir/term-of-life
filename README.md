* game of life

a conways game of life implemented with termion.
a learning rust project.
but still pretty cool in case you ever want to run game of life in a terminal.
how to:

select left click to make a cell alive, right click to kill it.
p for pause
c to continue
s to step
r to reset the grid

todo:
handle borders properly, currently it crashes if a live cell gets to a negative location.
